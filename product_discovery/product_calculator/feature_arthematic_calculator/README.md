# Simple Arithmetic Calculator in Python

## Overview and Summary

This document outlines the plan to develop a simple arithmetic calculator in Python. This calculator will allow users to perform basic mathematical operations like addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division. The priority of this feature is high as it forms the core functionality of our calculator application.

## Key Decisions and Conclusions

- The calculator will be built using Python's built-in functions, with no additional libraries required.
- The calculator will have a text-based user interface to take inputs from users and display the results.
- Error handling will be implemented to manage invalid inputs or mathematical errors (like division by zero).
- The calculator will be built modularly to allow for easy extension of functionality in the future.

## Important Details Discussed

### Acceptance Criteria

1. The calculator should allow users to input two numbers.
2. The calculator should allow users to select the operation they want to perform: addition, subtraction, multiplication, or division.
3. The calculator should correctly perform the selected operation on the two numbers and display the result.
4. The calculator should handle division by zero error gracefully and display an appropriate error message.
5. The calculator should clear the result after each operation or when the user decides to perform a new calculation.

### Dependencies

This feature is dependent on the availability of a Python environment to run the app.

## Next Steps or Action Items

- Set up a Python development environment if not already available.
- Begin development of the calculator application, adhering to the acceptance criteria and technical considerations outlined in this document.
- Regularly test the application to ensure it meets the acceptance criteria and handles errors appropriately.
- Once the application is developed and tested, it can be deployed and made available for use.
