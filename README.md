# prod-calculator

Simple text-based arithmetic calculator implemented in Python. It reads two
numbers, lets you pick an operation (addition, subtraction, multiplication, or
division), then prints the result while safely handling invalid input and
division by zero errors.

## Running the calculator

```bash
python3 calculator.py
```

Follow the prompts in the terminal to enter numbers and select an operation.
After each result you can choose to perform a new calculation or exit.
